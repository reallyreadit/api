<div style="margin:1em 0;">Dear @Model.Content.UserName,</div>
<div style="margin:1em 0;">Thanks for buying a subscription! We’re thrilled that you decided to start paying.</div>
<div style="margin:1em 0;">We’re proud that Readup isn’t free. That’s a big part of what makes it so special. It’s a better, more humane arrangement overall. Because you’re paying, the Readup team is highly motivated to make sure your experience on Readup is extremely positive.</div>
<div style="margin:1em 0;">Remember that most of what you pay (~90%) will go directly to the writers you read. And you can keep tabs - down to the penny!  - by clicking “My Impact.”</div>
<div style="margin:1em 0;">Don’t hesitate to reach out. I’d love to hear from you. Feel free to reply to this email.</div>
<div style="margin:1em 0;">
	Sincerely,<br />
 	Thor Galle<br />
