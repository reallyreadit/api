# VSCode Code Remote - Containers' Docker Compose tooling does not yet support supplying a custom
# project name via devcontainer.json. We want to name the project 'readup', and not 'dev-env' based
# on the location of docker-compose.yml
# See https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/512
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=readup
